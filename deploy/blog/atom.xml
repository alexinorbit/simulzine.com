&lt;p&gt;Searching for the right way to set up and maintain this blog and to overcome the restrictions that come with mainstream blogging software and services, I arrived at certain conclusions that you&amp;#8217;ll find in the following article. It&amp;#8217;s an article about the technical requirements of modern blogging where I consider recent trends and question traditional ways of getting things done. It addresses techies that are about to start blogging seriously, established bloggers and web developers who are looking for state-of-the-art&amp;nbsp;solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;planning-the-simulzinecom-project&#34;&gt;Planning the simulzine.com&amp;nbsp;project&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning to plan our next software project, we usually choose a familiar tool-set and known services. This way we are able to rapid prototype our application and then concentrate on the actual requirements of the project. But is this always the right path to follow? We can quickly think of how things can be build, we&amp;#8217;ve created things that function in the past, we feel comfortable about them and are often allergic to new tools. But this prevents us from perceiving better and smarter ways to fulfil our tasks and we often incorporate unnecessary components into the application. In order to broaden our perspective we need to be aware of the community, get out of our comfort zone of skills and rethink traditions. In the context of project planning, my suggestion is to find the time to experiment and where possible go with open standards. In the coming sections, I have noted some of the things I considered important when planning for this&amp;nbsp;blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;gratis-hosted-platforms&#34;&gt;Gratis hosted&amp;nbsp;platforms&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our favourite free of charge hosted platforms allow us to set up the appearance of our blog in no time and publish our thoughts right away. Popular blogging platforms like blogspot.com, wordpress.com are actually hosting CMSs with their expenses on their servers. But all of this comes with a price. We are restricted to limited configuration choices and third party liceses. We&amp;#8217;ll be using themes that everyone else uses, and even when we change the parameters, our blog will have the same look (a nice photo won&amp;#8217;t make much difference). Our content will be surrounded by your platform&amp;#8217;s banners, icons or logos. Most likely there will be advertising or links to other sites that we may not want to be displayed on our site. We&amp;#8217;ll not have complete ownership of our blog; even if the content we create is protected the domain does not belong to us. And moving our blog to another host or service demands quite an effort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;self-hosted-cmss&#34;&gt;Self hosted&amp;nbsp;CMSs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we most commonly choose to install the blogging software (usually a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_management_system&#34;&gt;Content Management System, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) on our web servers. Installation is pretty straightforward and it is accompanied by helpful tutorials. The setup of the underlying database may sometimes be tricky for some people, but many hosting providers offer a one-click installation for popular CMSs like Wordpress or Drupal. A self hosted &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; avoids most of the disadvantages of the gratis hosted platforms and allows greater control and flexibility over your blog. And since most of these CMSs are open source, we can install and modify plenty of wonderful themes or useful plug-ins that suit our blog&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in terms of design and layout, we are more autonomous with a self hosted &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;. We&amp;#8217;re tied to less company policies and we have more control over the content that we put on our site, no annoying logos, strange links or unwanted advertising. But keep in mind that we need to maintain and upgrade the software ourself and to do this we need to mess with the &amp;#8220;backend stuff&amp;#8221; (eg. Database). This process can cause a lot of headaches to some folks and it requires particular skills, but we shouldn&amp;#8217;t avoid it. Upgrading to the newer &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; version is crucial if we don&amp;#8217;t want our site to become outdated or run into security&amp;nbsp;risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CMSs serve massive and complicated websites, which receive frequent updates by multiple users. For community sites, e-commerce, archives, news portals, wikis, forums, file-sharing sites or galleries, CMSs are the right choice. And that&amp;#8217;s because you need a database to store large amounts of content. A &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;, after all, is also a  user interface for your database. It offers user-friendly navigation, facilitates the updating and aids the management of the diverse resources you store in your&amp;nbsp;database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To display the database content on the browser, our site has to be assembled (or generated) each time a client (user) accesses a page. This is a continuous activity that is often characterized as dynamic or, more accurately, database-driven. Database-driven websites need to execute code (most likely &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; and MySQL) on the server in order to communicate with the database and to display the required content back to the client&amp;#8217;s (user&amp;#8217;s) browser.  This process is resource hungry and slows things down (although a good caching setup can speed things up). Unfortunately database-driven webistes are also vulnerable to various malicious&amp;nbsp;attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;do-you-really-need-a-cms-for-your-blog&#34;&gt;Do you really need a &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; for your&amp;nbsp;blog?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately not. I found that the database and the accompanied &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; would be unnecessary components in my blog. I thought of my blog (or any other micro-site) as a printed magazine. The printed magazine consists of the front cover, the editorial, the table of contents and the content. Similarly, a simple blog consists of the front page, the list of your posts, the about section and your posts. However, this structure can also be achieved without a database or a &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; and thus without a dynamic setup like the one described above, which bears many disadvantages as to its complexity and performance. A fully functional and easy to manage blog can be built with the use of static &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; generators. A simple static micro site with a news section can also be developed the same way and enjoy all the comforts of pure &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; pages and many more&amp;nbsp;advantages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When talking about static &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; pages ones mind goes back to the beginning of the Internet where the web was just but plain hyper-connected &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; documents. Back then, the web&amp;#8217;s purpose was mainly about retrieving information and not interacting with it&amp;#8217;s content. Technological refinement over the last twenty years brought a giant leap in experience and active engagement, especially with the introduction of database-driven websites. However, the effectiveness of good old static web pages, in many areas, remains&amp;nbsp;unbeatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;static-html-generators&#34;&gt;Static &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Generators&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; Generators are simple and brilliant programs. They represent a practical way to create and maintain structured static web sites. They automate many procedures like navigation, design consistency, chronologically ordered list of contents, etc. They ouput &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; files on the basis of a set of templates where you describe the components and structure of your blog. They keep your content apart from the actual code of your blog, making it much  easier to&amp;nbsp;maintain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; Generators are not a new idea hitting the blogosphere. Back in the old days, Moveable Type used static &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; output to serve blogs, generating the pages on its webserver. With the appearance of open source software like, Jekyll, Hyde, Pelican and many others (there are really dozens of functional &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; generators out there), the potential of Static &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; Generators has become obvious. These programs run on our local machine giving such more control and flexibility over the process of designing, setting up and maintaining our micro-site or blog. They use templating languages to separate (or filter) the content from the layouts and they use simple markup languages like Markdown to reformat your text&amp;nbsp;files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit your new post with your favorite text editor, generate a new output site (single command), check locally, upload to the web. This is the workflow needed to upload a newly created post to your static blog. Static &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; generators are a growing trend among programmers. And for good reason: static &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; generators perform much better than popular CMSs and I recommend them for blogs and other&amp;nbsp;micro-sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-benefits-of-static-websites&#34;&gt;The benefits of static&amp;nbsp;websites&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set of static &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; pages performs well for the following&amp;nbsp;reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maintenance - A static blog is easier to maintain. Every post is a single file. We can compose or edit our posts in our favourite text editor, using an easy markdown language or by writing &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; (and Javascprit if you need to embed various dynamic components into your posts).I dislike &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;WYSIWYG&lt;/span&gt; editors because they lack control and implement unnecessary code into the site. The possibility to edit your blog on your local machine and preview articles without any downtime is also a great helper. I don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about updating any software or maintaining a database to keep my blog up to date and&amp;nbsp;running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speed - Static pages load relatively faster than database-driven pages. The absence of server-side processes for querying the database makes loading faster. To display a static page, the browser just needs to load an existing &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; file from the server and assemble it on the&amp;nbsp;screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resources - Static pages are resource-friendly for the web-server as well for the user&amp;#8217;s local machine. Minimizing memory and processing resources is always welcome, especially on mobile&amp;nbsp;devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mobility - In contrast to database-driven blogs, where our posts are table entries of a database, in a static blog all the posts are single text files, kept in one folder. This is very handy for migrating or transporting when you need to port your content to another system or server in the future. This is also very &amp;#8220;digital repository&amp;#8221; friendly as we can read later&amp;nbsp;on. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;backup - All the code and content of a static site is kept in one place. We only need to copy-paste or push a folder into our favorite repository and we&amp;#8217;re done. All our work is safely kept in our local machine, our web-server or the cloud service of our choice. This is a lot easier than backing up a database and a (modified)&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;security - A static configuration is kind of a sealed structure regarding external interventions to our web-server. The absence of dynamic processes makes it very hard or even impossible for malicious attacks, like cross-site scripting, to harm your&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;customization - If you are an experienced web developer then you&amp;#8217;ll find it more comfortable to design and layout your blog using straightforward &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;/Javascript code, instead of messing around with your &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s often weird and painful&amp;nbsp;peculiarities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digitization&amp;nbsp;perspective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might want to consider choosing a static &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; generator, only because your content is kept in single files - digital documents, and that&amp;#8217;s a big deal if you ask me. Besides the mobility benefits you have (e.g. moving to another server), you can also enhance your articles with your preferred metadata schema and render them fully searchable and interoperable with various digital repositories. The single document possibility is similar to the digitization of books or other cultural objects, where raw files are enhanced with metadata to fit chosen standards. The same can be done with your authored content. It would be something like treating your blog like an ever growing e-book that&amp;#8217;s compatible with popular metadata standards. Think of it! Ready to deliver your marked up content to all kind of digital repositories (and devices) by the standards they use is a great asset. And everything is being kept in a folder&amp;nbsp;;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;tradeoff&#34;&gt;Tradeoff&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is always a tradeoff when choosing one path over another. Although you can embed various dynamic components to your static blog via client side scripting, you cannot incorporate more advanced features like role-based access control or a self hosted commenting&amp;nbsp;system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are planning to create a multi-user site or a blog with multiple authors, a &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; is the only choice for&amp;nbsp;you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really need comments, with a Static &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; Generator, you will propably have to use proprietary software. If you don&amp;#8217;t mind publicizing proprietary software on your blog, you can easily embed (via Javascprit) a commenting system like Disqus or IntenseDebate; but these services do not save conversations on your own web-server and you are again bound  to third party licenses &lt;span class=&#34;amp&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; services. However, if you have the skills to set up a standalone commenting system and you want to embrace foss (free open source software), then consider &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/phusion/juvia/&#34;&gt;Juvia&lt;/a&gt;, which is a one man&amp;#8217;s effort and not a SaaS (Software as a Service), so you need to host it your self.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, for the time being, I consider social media platforms and e-mail a sufficient way to&amp;nbsp;communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you care about how to future proof your efforts as a blogger, then weigh your options carefully and make sure you protect and deploy your articles on the web in the most convenient way. If you are finally convinced that you do not need a database and a &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; for your blog or any other micro-site project, then choose your static &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; generator with care. I have chosen Hyde because it uses the Jinja2 templating language, which is very similar to Django&amp;#8217;s and is written in Python. There is a wide selection of static site generators written in many languages. If you have experience with Ruby, then you will probably go with&amp;nbsp;Jekyll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In setting up this blog, my first concern was to overcome the need for a database. Searching for the people that have done this before me, I stumbled upon several &lt;a href=&#34;http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/01/moving-from-django-to-hyde/&#34;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; that talked about static site generators, which helped me find the right tool and start experimenting until I was satisfied with the results. From the historian&amp;#8217;s point of view, the static &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; generators represent a return to the roots, to the beginning of the web where everything was just hyperconnected documents. In my opinion, these tools remind us of the forgotten benefits of static &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; pages. They minimize complexity for simple tasks and as such they are future proof. It might seem that you are looking backwards - and you are! but you have good reason to do so. You are making certain that your efforts to produce and present all this great content the right way, will have a sustainable&amp;nbsp;outcome! &lt;/p&gt;            </content>
