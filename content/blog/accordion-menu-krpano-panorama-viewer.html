{% mark excerpt -%}

My latest project, with orbitlab, was the creation of an interactive <a href="http://acropolis-virtualtour.gr" target="_blank">virtual tour at the Acropolis of Athens</a>. Amongst others, it involved the acquisition of five gigapixel scale images from the Acropolis Monuments. The project was an initiative of the <a href="http://www.ysma.gr" target="_blank">Acropolis Restoration Service</a>, the organization responsible for the restoration of the tormented and partially destroyed 2500 years old Acropolis Monuments over the past 30 years.

<br/><br/>
The decision to adopt <span class="italic_style">state of the art</span> technological solutions to "bring online" the entirety of the Acropolis is not merely a statement for the preservation work undertaken by the organization, but also a great contribution to the institution's mission to promote remote access to cultural heritage.

# Choosing the Point of View #

The monument facades to be photographed, were previously examined for proper lighting conditions, required for a long  gigapixel shooting. The point of view was carefully chosen with respect to insidious distortions that come up when you are too close to the monument. About 30 m in front of the east facade would not only show details of restoration works, but also produce the "wow!" effect when zooming in the final gigapixel image. The sun should be high, minimizing shadows. The east facade of the Parthenon was photographed by our crew at noon 13.00 for about one hour in September of 2010.

# Things to consider before shooting #

* Weather : sunny, clear atmosphere, no clouds (bad for stitching)
* Sun Position: The sun has to be in a convenient position (during the hole shooting!) to properly light the part of the monument to be photographed
* Crowding : You don't want people in your shots. When possible set up a perimeter. Prepare for delays, repeated shots, manual shooting with the robotic arm.
* Focusing : You may want to switch to manual focusing at areas where foreground objects could disturb your depth of field
* Know your gear:  Estimate the time needed to complete the shots! You don't want the night to come or run out of battery. Estimate file size, keep backup!
* Take Notes: Especially about duplicate shots and downloaded photographs from your camera (saves a lot of boring work afterward!)

# Available Gear #

* Camera : Nikon D700 
* Lens : Sigma 500mm f/4.5 EX HSM 
* robotic camera mount : EPIC Pro

Our crew programmed the robotic rig to capture an area of 55&#176; horizontal and 40&#176; vertical field of view with a focal length of 500mm, that means a 16 X 17 grid with 272 cells (camera positions) - in three different exposure levels - that makes us 816 photographs and about 8.5 GB of raw data on the D700.
