		<h1> Hi there ! </h1>
		<p>I' m Alex. <span style="font-family: 'Audiowide',  sans-serif; font-size:12px;">SIMULZINE</span> is mostly my blog.</p> 
		<p>This is about what i'm learning partly as a programmer, partly as a designer & partly as content creator of interactive applications.</p> 
		<p>Six years ago I co-founded <a href="http://www.orbitlab.gr" target="_blank">orbitlab</a>, a creative studio focused on interactive media. I have been involved in all kinds of <a href="http://www.orbitlab.gr/case-studies" target="_blank">projects</a> with big companies, research centers and other organizations.</p>
		<p> I like to experiment and favor state of the art practices for my projects. I am a great fan of horizontal collaborative teams that have clear aims. The potential of the internet  as a co-working space has already revealed itself and adventurous initiatives are taking advantage of the web's unique abilities to narrow distances and bring people from around the world together to work on common projects. Free/open source software or Wikipedia, are indications of larger possibilities.</p>
